# CentralizeLoadResources

A tool to centralize all LoadResources scripts available in a TestScript folder to a single subfolder. This prevents having to edit permissions for each LoadResources file individually in the TouchStone GUI.

For more info on how to use the tool, please check `ant/build.xml`
